# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
Step 1: Start the Program.

Step 2: Import dataset and print head,info of the dataset.

Step 3: check for null values.

Step 4: Import kmeans and fit it to the dataset.

Step 5:Plot the graph using elbow method.

Step 6: Print the predicted array.

Step 7: Plot the customer segments.

Step 8: End the program.
## Program:
